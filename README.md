# Machine Learning Repository

This repository serves as a space for me to write and store my machine learning projects and also to provide learning resources for others interested in machine learning.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to document my journey in machine learning and showcase the projects I have worked on. By sharing my code and projects, I hope to contribute to the machine learning community and help others learn and grow in this field.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

- **Projects**: This directory contains various machine learning projects I have completed. Each project is organized in its own subdirectory and includes code, data, and documentation.

- **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that cover different machine learning concepts, techniques, and tutorials. These notebooks are designed to provide a hands-on learning experience and serve as educational resources for beginners and intermediate learners.

- **Resources**: This directory contains additional resources, such as datasets, reference materials, and useful links, that can aid in learning machine learning concepts and techniques.
