# Data-Driven Modeling
This repository contains code examples for simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression using scikit-learn library in Python. These notebooks are designed as introductory materials for machine learning.

## Getting Started
1. To get started with the code, follow these steps:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Mahsasalimi/Machine-Learning/Data-Driven-Modeling.git
https://github.com/Mahsasalimi/Machine-Learning/tree/9e4f005f50345b20d4ba4481a7288c32f503adea/Data%20Driven%20Modeling

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Data-Driven-Modeling

## Simple Linear Regression
The Data_Driven_Modeling_1.ipynb notebook is a simple introduction to linear regression using scikit-learn. It includes an example where a simple linear regression model is trained on a dataset with one input variable (x) and one output variable (y). The code calculates the coefficient of determination, intercept, and slope of the linear regression model. It also showcases how to make predictions using the trained model.

## Multiple Linear Regression
The Data_Driven_Modeling_2.ipynb notebook extends the regression analysis to multiple input variables using the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn. It shows an example of training a multiple linear regression model on a dataset with two input variables (x1 and x2) and one output variable (y). Similar to the simple linear regression, it calculates the coefficient of determination, intercept, and coefficients of the multiple linear regression model. The code also demonstrates prediction using the trained model.

## Polynomial Regression
The Data_Driven_Modeling_2.ipynb notebook demonstrates polynomial regression using scikit-learn. It showcases how to transform the input features using polynomial features and train a linear regression model on the transformed data. The example uses a dataset with two input variables (x1 and x2) and one output variable (y) to perform polynomial regression of degree 2. The code calculates the coefficient of determination, intercept, coefficients, and predicts the response using the trained model.
