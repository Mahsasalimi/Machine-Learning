# Telecommunications Customer Segmentation
## Introduction
The Telecommunications provider in this project has segmented its customer base into four groups based on service usage patterns. The objective is to use all available features, including demographic data, to predict the group membership of customers. By doing so, the company can customize offers and services for individual prospective customers. This is a classification problem where we aim to build a model that can predict the class of a new or unknown case based on the provided dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various features such as region, age, marital status, and other relevant information about the customers. These features will be utilized to predict the customer group membership. The target variable is called "custcat," which represents the four customer groups:

1. Basic Service
2. E-Service
3. Plus Service
4. Total Service


## Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a classifier using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the class of unknown cases. By utilizing all available features, we aim to determine the most suitable group for each customer.

## Implementation
The project will involve the following steps:

1. Data exploration and preprocessing: Analyzing the dataset, handling missing values (if any), and preparing the data for model training. This includes feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Model training: Training the KNN classifier using the training data and evaluating its performance on the testing data.
3. Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tuning the KNN algorithm by experimenting with different values of the hyperparameters (e.g., the number of neighbors) to achieve the best performance.
5. Predictions: Applying the trained model to predict the customer group for new or unknown cases.

## Requirements
The following dependencies are required to run the project:
- Python 
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc. (provide specific library versions if necessary)
- You can install the dependencies using pip:
 ``pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib ``

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the above command.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `Telecommunications-Provider-Customer.ipynb` file.
4. Execute the main script or run the Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the results.

## Conclusion
By successfully building a KNN classifier using all available features, we can predict the customer group membership in the Telecommunications provider. This information can help the company tailor their services and offers to individual customers, leading to improved customer satisfaction and business growth.
