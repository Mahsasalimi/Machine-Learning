# Non-Linear Regression Analysis for China's GDP

This repository contains a notebook that focuses on fitting a non-linear regression model to the dataset representing China's GDP from 1960 to 2014. The dataset consists of two columns: `value` and `year`.

## Background

Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. However, if the data shows a curvy trend, linear regression may not produce accurate results. In such cases, non-linear regression can be more suitable.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains information on China's GDP over a specific time period. It consists of the following columns:

- `value`: Represents the GDP value for a given year.
- `year`: Represents the year corresponding to the GDP value.

## Analysis

The notebook in this repository demonstrates how to fit a non-linear model to the provided dataset. It explores different non-linear regression techniques and evaluates their performance.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

- `china_gdp_NoneLinearRegression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `china_gdp.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib


## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the above command.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `china_gdp_NoneLinearRegression.ipynb` file.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the non-linear regression analysis.

Feel free to modify the notebook and dataset as needed for your own analysis.
